Globalization along with the continually changing landscape of the Internet made digital streaming services the better alternative for cable or pay-TV. The following are a few more reasons why this disruptive technology rose to popularity:

### Customized content

Netflix’s algorithm suggests new content unique to every user based on how they interact with the service. It takes into account the nuances of the content the user previously watched and how they rated other titles. Through this, the algorithm suggests new shows or films that audiences would normally overlook. This innovative technology means that Netflix anticipates what an audience needs before the audience even thinks about it. People’s regular pay-TV still requires manual browsing and the content is not curated to the customer’s palette. 

### Creative Freedom

Adding to Netflix’s popularity is the diversity of their talent pool and content. As a venture capitalist, Netflix invests its deep pockets and other resources in start-ups (i.e. new series or film). This allows Netflix to churn out new original and exclusive content at a faster pace than their competitors, along with the fact that the streaming service is available worldwide except in a few select countries. According to the streaming search engine *Reelgood* as reported by *Business Insider*, Netflix has the most original shows at 674 compared to its competitors: HBO Max (190). Amazon Prime Video (134), Hulu (87), Disney Plus (26), Apple TV Plus (23). The same report also states Netflix having the most “high-quality” TV shows, defined by *Reelgood* as having an 8.0 and above score on IMDb (Clark, 2020). 

This model gives Netflix an edge over its competitors, but it is also the reason why some new shows get canceled rather quickly before they even have the chance to actually take off. At the end of the day, Netflix is a business. However, it remains a better alternative for both seasoned pros (e.g. David Fincher, Martin Scorsese) and novices waiting for their big breaks. Netflix allows them creative freedom as opposed to more family-oriented brands like Disney. 

### Netflix is still the King of Streaming

Netflix had several major competitors during the early months of 2020. There were new launches from companies that have been around far longer than Netflix. Among them are Disney+ (2019), AppleTV+ (2019), and NBCUniversal’s Peacock (2020), all of which had access to thousands of titles that are no longer available on Netflix. In early March, Netflix was laying off employees as the company overhauled its marketing strategies. According to Netflix’s quarterly earnings report as published by *The Hollywood Reporter*, Netflix’s global subscriber base rose 20 percent to 167 million members. However, viewership in the U.S. and Canada has slowed even if these were the regions with higher market saturation compared to the rest of the world (Masters, Sandberg, 2020). 

In a report published by *Forbes* early in November, Disney+ dominated the ‘streaming wars’ as its subscribers rose to 73.7 million, surpassing the company’s expectation to achieve it in 2024 (Freeman, 2020). The price of a Disney+ subscription is offered at $6.99 (up to 4K resolution) a month in the U.S., still cheaper than Netflix’s Basic Plan of $8.99 (4K resolution is available with the Premium Package at $15.99/mo). Disney also has the advantage of time as an entertainment company so they do not have as much pressure as Netflix to churn out fresh new content. According to that same report, Netflix has Projected Original 2020 Content Spend of  $4.5 billion while Disney+ only has Projected Original 2020 Content Spend of $1.3 billion. The estimates of Netflix’s expenditure on new content is still larger than its other competitors: Amazon Prime ( $1.3 billion), Apple TV+ ($1.9 billion), Hulu ($170 million), Peacock ($1 billion), HBO Max ($1.2 billion) CBS All Access ($800 million). 

Nevertheless, Netflix’s early investments in research and development made it ubiquitous - compatible for almost every device and its service is available globally. Although Disney+ is Netflix’s main competitor, for now, Netflix remains the king of streaming services worldwide.
